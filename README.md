# iris-ml-project
Machine Learning project on the classic Iris dataset using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest for flower classification.

The Iris dataset is one of the most popular datasets in machine learning.
This project aims to build a classification model that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on its features:
Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

⚙ Technologies Used
Python 
NumPy, Pandas → Data handling
Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization
Scikit-learn → Machine Learning models & evaluation

Steps in the Project
Data Loading & Exploration
Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn.
Visualized feature distributions and correlations.

Data Preprocessing
Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).
Standardized features for better performance.

Model Building

Implemented multiple classification models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
